I've always known the importance of having a personal website, if not just for domain security, but the last time I updated mine was way back in 2016 - before I even got into front end development! I followed a tutorial and used a theme for a Jekyll site on Digital Ocean, and while it worked just fine, I wanted to create something of my own that I could be proud of (and didn't cost me anything to host!) So, using the hottest new tech, I took my winter break and did just that.

The site uses the fantastic Gatsbyjs framework, which allows me to have a statically generated single-page-application with React and Webpack. Was also my first time using GraphQL, and while there was a bit of a learning curve, it made me a fan.
